  <h1>Exploring the use of Dot Matrix Printers on Typography and ASCII Art</h1>
  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>Dot Matrix printers are one of the first forms of printers to be created and they utilize physical stamping of soaked ink sheets by the machine onto paper to create small dots. Many of these dots in a line and other configurations will create the characters used to create text documents and other such physical mediums. The introduction of Dot Matrix printers had a huge impact on Typographic art which is the use of numbers and letters to create artwork. One example of this is how ASCII art was made more accessible for the general public which made the creative boundaries broaden in this field. Overall This invention led to a major breakthrough in digital media and has effects on typographic art that can be seen to this day. (129 words exclusive.)</p>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The first dot matrix printer was invented in 1925 by German inventor Rudolf Hell and patented in 1929, however even after modern developments of printing technology and the many advancements and upgrades in the field, dot matrix printers are still used to this day. The main reason for this is its efficiency and cost for the specific task of making multiple copies of text and characters in large factories. In this text specifically however I will be looking at one of its more niche use cases which is the use of dot matrix printers to create aesthetic images using its very specific way of printing, or in other words, the use of them to create typographic art. Although Typographic art existed before the invention of dot matrix printers, their introduction led to a huge boost in the production of such art for a number of reasons.</p>
