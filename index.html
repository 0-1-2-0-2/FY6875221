  <h1>Exploring the use of Dot Matrix Printers on Typography and ASCII Art</h1>
  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>Dot Matrix printers are one of the first forms of printers to be created and they utilize physical stamping of soaked ink sheets by the machine onto paper to create small dots. Many of these dots in a line and other configurations will create the characters used to create text documents and other such physical mediums. The introduction of Dot Matrix printers had a huge impact on Typographic art which is the use of numbers and letters to create artwork. One example of this is how ASCII art was made more accessible for the general public which made the creative boundaries broaden in this field. Overall This invention led to a major breakthrough in digital media and has effects on typographic art that can be seen to this day. (129 words exclusive.)</p>
