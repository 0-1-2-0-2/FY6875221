  <h1 id="Title">Exploring the use of Dot Matrix Printers on Typography and ASCII Art</h1>
  <h2 id="Abstract1">Abstract</h2>
  <p id="Abstract2">Dot Matrix printers are one of the first forms of printers to be created and they utilize physical stamping of soaked ink sheets by the machine onto paper to create small dots. Many of these dots in a line and other configurations will create the characters used to create text documents and other such physical mediums. The introduction of Dot Matrix printers had a huge impact on Typographic art which is the use of numbers and letters to create artwork. One example of this is how ASCII art was made more accessible for the general public which made the creative boundaries broaden in this field. Overall This invention led to a major breakthrough in digital media and has effects on typographic art that can be seen to this day.</p>
  <h2 id="Introduction1_InText">Introduction</h2>
  <p id="Introduction2_InText">The first dot matrix printer was invented in 1925 by German inventor Rudolf Hell and patented in 1929, however even after modern developments of printing technology and the many advancements and upgrades in the field, dot matrix printers are still used to this day. The main reason for this is its efficiency and cost for the specific task of making multiple copies of text and characters in large factories. In this text specifically however I will be looking at one of its more niche use cases which is the use of dot matrix printers to create aesthetic images using its very specific way of printing, or in other words, the use of them to create typographic art. Although Typographic art existed before, their introduction led to a huge boost in the production of such art for a number of reasons.</p>
  <h2 id="Main1">Analysis</h2>
  <h3 id="Main2">Typographic art in general</h3>
  <p id="Main3">One of the most recognizable forms of typographic art is called ASCII art. It is ‘a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from the 95 printable (from a total of 128) characters defined by the 1963 ASCII Standard. Some Ascii art uses ASCII compliant character sets with proprietary extended set of characters (beyond the 128 characters of standard 7-bit ASCII).’(Asciville, 2024) However it also refers to ASCII art also being a more encompassing term for most art created using text, so effectively, ACSII art and typographic art are one and the same. There were three main reasons that ACSII art first arose, first of all the printers at the time ‘lacked graphics ability and thus characters were used in place of graphic marks.’, this technological limit is also the reason many other art forms in history arose. Secondly, ‘ASCII art was also used in early e-mail when images could not be embedded’. And thirdly it was used not just out of how it looked or to please the eye but it had more of a practical use being that it would mark divisions between different print jobs so that the change could be spotted more easily. (From-ASCII-Art, 2023). Examples(Structure, 2010)<br>
    <br>The lifetime of typographic art has seen an evolution of changes from morphing text to create interesting shapes() to more modern examples of digital art as this art form progressed. The invention of typewriters came along in 1874 however the first recorded ACSII art using this were around the 1960’s with famous names such as Kenneth Knowlton arising (Kenneth Knowlton, 2005). However typographic art e.g. Flora FF Stacy's ‘Butterfly’ predate this to 1898(oztypewriter, 2020).<br>

  <h3 id="Main4">The invention of Dot matrix Printers</h3>
  <p id="Main5">Fritz Karl Preikschat is the sole inventor of the dot matrix printer. ‘From 1952 until 1954, Fritz Karl Preikschat submitted five patents for his invention of a teleprinter with seven print wires for a 7×5 dot matrix’, however due to preexisting technology and a lack of demand, the idea was shown no interest by his current employers. This is one of the many reasons that the invention of the printer is attributed instead to Robert howard more often times as he was the first person to create a practical working version whilst employed at Epson. One other contributor to the invention was Yasuki Kawai who was instrumental in further development whilst working at Epson.</p>
  <h3 id="Main6">Advantages of them vs other options</h3>
  <p id="Main7">Dot matrix printers are devices that use electricity to create such imprints. “In such devices the characters are formed by an array of dots which are impressed by needles mechanically connected to electromechanical actuators (hammers).”(ieexplore, 1989).In summary, they work by indenting paper with an ink soaked sheet. A series of needles are extended and retracted by a magnetic current induced in a coil, and a spring respectively. They will print a row of dots and then move down a row.<br>
   <br>In terms of comparing them to other printers like the inkjet and laser printers that we use today, the more modern printers are far superior as print quality is just better as well as most other factors. The only reason that they are still used in their niche fields is that they can print arbitrary characters and also are much better at multiple print carbon copying as well as their effective lack of maintenance.(soscanhelp, 2021)<br>
   <br>The main effect that they had on the introduction digital art was as they were the main medium/ device that was available at the time to create digital created physical artwork, the device used to realise such artwork was the matrix printer, when typographic art became more prevalent. One example of this is ASCII art as the original ASCII artworks were realised using dot matrix printers.
  </p>
  <h2 id="Conclusion1">Conclusion +(digital art in the future because of effect of dmp)</h2>
  <p id="Conclusion2">In summary, Dot matrix printers are an old device that was originally created to make repetitive printing possible. They have since been outdated but are still used in very niche cases. Their introduction made typographic art available and without their invention, such art may not have struck of as openly or as early as it did.<br>
   <br>In my opinion  I believe that typographic art was influenced a large amount by the invention of dot matrix printers however I also believe that art of such manner would still have arisen later had printers of the same purpose but differing mechanisms been created either later or at the same time. This is as I think that the invention simply made realising such artwork possible rather than the invention of actual digital art. This being said, I don’t think that art such as ASCII and other art forms such as halftone art would have been as popular in our day as I think that the limitations that came with the dot matrix printer made this type of art come around and had a printer without these limitations been invented first then this particular form of typographic would not have as much prevalence
